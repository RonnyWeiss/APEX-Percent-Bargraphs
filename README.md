![Screenshot](https://github.com/RonnyWeiss/APEX-Percent-Bargraphs/blob/master/screenshot.gif?raw=true)

The plug-in draws some nice percent bargraphs in APEX or in native HTML page. It was mainly created for the demo at the DOAG Webinar on 01.02.2019 - https://dlvr.it/Qwzkw9 
However, it can be used at any time.
